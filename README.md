# password-generator
Welcome to my Random Password Generator ReadMe.
When the user clicks the button, they should be able to select a desired password length between 8-128 characters as well as select desired character types including password inclusion of uppercase or lowercase letters. 

This application uses soley HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript in it's design.
